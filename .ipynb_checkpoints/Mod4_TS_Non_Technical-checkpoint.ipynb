A financial vehicle, the XLV Healthcare mutual fund (ticker symbol: XLV), was selected for further analysis. \n",

    "A full Time Series analysis is conducted to look at the historic performance of the XLV as well as to forecast it's movement into the future. By taking in the historic information and movement of the closing prices of the XLV dating back 21 years to the end of 1998, we can look at past movements combined with TS modeling to create an accurate and confident projection of future prices. Multiple time series models with varying parameters were tested and compared to each other. After these comparisons a single model was selected and then the XLV data was fit to the selected model for forecasting of the future XLV closing prices. "
